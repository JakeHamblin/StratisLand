# StratisLand
A simple PHP landing page to be used by individuals and businesses. Provides a number of customizable options for end users, including custom text, colors, and images.

## Installation
**PHP 8.1 or higher is required**

To install StratisLand, you first need to being by acquiring a domain and hosting. For both, I recommend [Hosturly](https://hambl.in/hosturly). I am a partner of Hosturly and longtime user. I currently own my own dedicated server and colocate it through Hosturly and I absolutely love their service. For specific steps on setting up shared hosting with Hosturly, take a look at my [documentation](https://docs.jakehamblin.com/shared-hosting) on shared hosting.

After acquiring hosting and a domain, you need to upload this repository into the root folder for the domain. This can be done by downloading this repository or using cPanel's git client. With this now completed, you can rename the `config.php.template` folder to `config.php` and begin filling out the config. After filling out the config, you are ready to go
